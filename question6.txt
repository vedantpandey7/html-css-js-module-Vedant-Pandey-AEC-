Q6)What are IDs and classes in HTML, and how do they differ?

Ans).IDs are the unique identifiers for a single element on the web page. It ensures that each element having an id is distinct from all others on the page. Itâ€™s like giving a specific name to an element. For instance, you might assign an id to a particular section of your webpage that you want to link or apply some property, styling, functionalities.
On the contrary, the class attribute in HTML serves to identify multiple elements as belonging to a particular group or having a shared style. Think of classes as tags that categorize elements with shared characteristics. For instance, you might use a class to style all buttons on your webpage similarly.

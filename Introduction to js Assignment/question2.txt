Question: What are data types in Javascript? Explain the different types of data types with examples.
Solution: In JavaScript, data types refer to the different types of values that can be assigned to variables. JavaScript has both primitive data types and non-primitive data types (also known as reference types).

1. Primitive Data Types
These are the basic types of data that are immutable (cannot be changed once they are set). When you assign a primitive data type to a variable, you are directly assigning the value.

String: A sequence of characters enclosed in single, double, or backticks (template literals).

let name = "John"; 
let greeting = 'Hello, World!'; 
let message = `Hi, ${name}!`; // template literal

Number: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
let age = 25; // integer
let price = 99.99; // float
let temperature = -5; // negative number

Boolean: Represents a value of either true or false.

let isActive = true;  // boolean
let isFinished = false; // boolean


Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value has the value undefined.
let score; // undefined

2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

These types store references to the data rather than the actual value. They are mutable and can be changed.

Object: A collection of key-value pairs where keys are strings and values can be of any type.
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    isActive: true
}; // object


Array: A special type of object used to store ordered collections of data. Arrays can hold any data type.
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]; // array
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // array

Function: A block of code that can be invoked or called to perform a task. Functions are objects in JavaScript.
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
greet(); // function

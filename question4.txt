Q4)What is semantic HTML? List some semantic and non-semantic elements.

ans).Semantic HTML tags are used to define the meaning of the content they contain.
Tags like <header>, <article>, and <footer> are semantic HTML tags, they specify the role of the content present on them. While <div> and <span> are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements. They work only as content holders but do not indicate what type of content they contain or what role that particular content plays on the page.
The main reason to use Semantic HTML tags is, it becomes easier to read and understand. Search engines weigh keyword importance by their placement in the HTML hierarchy. It means keywords enclosed in a <h1> tag are given more importance than those enclosed in an <p>.

Some of the semantic elements are--

<header>
<nav>
<main>
<article>
<section>
<aside>
<footer>
They all defines a page's structure and readbility.

Some of the NON-Semantic elements are--

<div>
<span>
<b>
<i>

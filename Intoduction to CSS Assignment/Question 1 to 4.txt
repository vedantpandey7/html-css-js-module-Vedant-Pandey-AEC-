1).What is the use of float property? Which property is the better alternative to it?

Ans).The float property is used to position the elements to the left or the right of the container while allowing other content to flow around it.
It is not Commonly used these days.
The best alternative of this in todays world is the flex-box which is ideal for the on-dimensional layouts. And if we are working in 2-D environment then grid is the alternative which we can use at the place of float.

2).Explain the difference between absolute and relative positions.

Ans).The position property in CSS defines how an element is positioned in a document. The two common values, absolute and relative, behave differently:
1. Relative Position (position: relative                                                                                                                ;)
The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
Other elements do not move when a relative element is shifted.
You can adjust its position using top, right, bottom, and left.

2. Absolute Position (position: absolute                                                                                              ;)
The element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., an ancestor with relative, absolute, or fixed position).
If no positioned ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the <html> (viewport).
The element is removed from the normal document flow, meaning other elements ignore its space.

Key Differences:
Relative | Absolute
Positioned relative to Its normal position.| Positioned relative to Nearest positioned ancestor.
Moves when scrolled. | Scroll Only if inside a scrollable ancestor.
Use for slight adjustment without breaking | Used for floating elements,overlays,tooltips.
layout. |
Remains in the documents flow. | Removed from the documents flow.




3).What are the different types of CSS Selectors?


Ans).So the Selectors are used to style specific elements in HTML.They use to target an html element and the with the help of that various CSS styling is added to it.
Now there are many type of Selectors like:

Universal Selector).
Selects all elements in the document.
Example:
* { color: red; }

Element Selector).
Selects elements by their tag name.
Example:
p { font-size: 16px; }

Class Selector (.)).
Selects elements with a specific class attribute.
and multiple classes on the same element.
Example:
.box { background-color: lightblue; }

Id Selector (#)).
Selects an element with a specific id attribute.

Example:
#header { font-weight: bold; }

Attribute Selector).
Selects elements based on the presence or
value of an attribute.
Example:
input[type="text"] { border: 1px solid blue; }
a[href^="https"] { color: green; }

Combinators).
Combinators define the relationship between
two selectors.
Example:
div p { color: blue; } [Descendant]
div > p { color: green; } [Child]
h2 + p { margin-top: 0; } [Adjacent Sibling]
h2 ~ p { color: red; } [General Sibling]

Pseudo-classes).
Pseudo-classes are used to define the special
state of an element.
Example:
button:hover { background-color: gray;}
a:active { color: red; }
p:first-child { font-weight: bold; }

Pseudo-elements).
Pseudo-elements allow you to style the specific
part of an element.
Example:
p::before { content: "Note: "; font-weight:
bold; }
p::after { content: " (End)"; font-size: 12px; }




4).How are inline and block elements different from each other?

Ans). The inline and the block elements differ from each othr in various factors,like.

                Block elements                          |           Inline elements
            Full width of parent.                       |      Only as wide as content.
            Starts on a new line                        |      Does not start on a new line.
            Can contain both block and inline elements  |      Can contain only inline elements.
            Layout structuring.                         |      Styling small parts of text.
